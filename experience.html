						<h1>Project Engineer at Sol-Up USA</h1>
					</header>	
					<p>In this role, I gained experience with energy systems. I learned design methodology, support, and analysis. I also leveled up my Excel (VBA) and Google Sheets (JS) skills here. Some other softwares utilized at Sol-Up include AutoCAD, OpenSolar/Nearmap, and Aurora. I had the opportunity to build an inventory management application using mostly JavaScript, HTML, and Google Sheets. I also had the opportunity to work closely with our Project Manager and got to learn about project coordination and development. Overall, my experience at Sol-Up really gave me that extra bit of engineering experience that wasn't a part of schooling. I couldn't have asked for a better senior year job.</p>

					<h1>BIM Operator at Cal-Pac Painting</h1>
					</header>
					<p>In this position, my main area was quality assurance. My job was to walk jobsites with an architect/engineering punchlist and confirm that standards set by the general contractor were met. The software I used was AutoDesk BIM360. With this application, I could access the punchlists on a tablet and correspond with the general contractors and other subcontractors about project details. My other duty was to aid the estimator by making inferences about area to be painted based off blueprints. This was important in the estimation process because paint made up a good majority of the total job cost. Overall, this job gave me great experience with quality assurance and reading technical documents. I also got to grow my communication skills through correspondance with other contractors.</p>

					<h1>Engineering Student<h1/>
					</header>
					<p>As a computer engineering student, I was able to take courses in both electrical engineering and computer science. On the EE side, I studied concepts such as electricity and magnetism, circuit analysis, power and energy, electronics, and sensor systems. On the CS side I studied things like data structures, algorithm analysis, operating systems, and cloud applications. Bridging CS and EE is what computer engineering is. So I also took courses in digital design, processor architecture, Internet of Things Systems, microcontrollers, robotics, data compression, information coding/encryption, FPGA's, and hardware description languages. Some of the languages I enjoy using are: C++/C, Python, Matlab, JavaScript, Verilog, and x86 Assemly. Some of the software tools I've utilized in school are: SPICE, Logic Analyzer, ModelSim, ROS (Robot Operating System), Git, Linux, and more. All in all my engineering education has not only given me the technical skills needed to solve real world problems, but the ability to multitask and work under great pressure.  </p>
					<header>
					<h1>Math Student</h1>
					<p>As a math student, I took courses in calculus (I-III), differential equations, linear algebra, complex analysis, formal logic, proofs, and advanced probability. Studying mathematics has allowed me to view problems in an analytical, quantitive way. This leads to efficient solutions that can be simulated and modeled before implimentation. Although I stuck with courses in applied mathematics, I also enjoy pure mathematics as numbers and patterns have always been beautiful to me. Overall, studying math has only made my engineering and analytical skills stronger. </p>
