					<p>For this project, we turned a DE2 Development Board equipped with a Cyclone II FPGA into a menu-driven gaming console. The three games included a target shooting game, Connect-4, and Tic-Tac-Toe. My role was to implement sound, design shape-drawing packages, and aid with the overall modular design of the project. We used VHDL and some Verilog.</p>

					<h1>Autonomous Mobile Robot</h1>
					</header> 
					<p>This project utilized a Romi32u4 control board with a Raspberry Pi 3 and ROS. The main goal for the robot to get from point A to point B  without a person controlling it and without running into obstacles. We achieved this with two main components. First, we attached LIDAR sensors all sides of the robot. This allowed the robot to detect objects around it and avoid them. Next we used the concept of probabilistic localization. This allowed the robot to map its environment, in turn achieving the action of getting from point A to B without running into any obstacles. We used Python and C++ for this project.</p>

					<h1>Senior Design - Hotel Bed Lifter</h1>
					<p>Abstract:</p>
					<p>The Hotel Bed Lifter is designed as an installable system to eliminate the manual labor involved with replacing sheets and remaking a bed. The target market is hospitality industry management and workers. The product raises a mattress up and separates it from the box spring beneath using scissor lift mechanics powered by an electric motor. This solves two major problems for the general guest room attendants who, up until this point, have been doing the work this system is designed for themselves. First, it relieves the strain put on the attendants back from constantly bending over to get closer to the bed. Second, it allows the bedmaker to slide the sheets and comforter between the mattress and box spring without enduring the weight of the mattress and gives the joints in their hands relief of pressure. The system will improve the quality of work life for guest room attendants by reducing physical hardship and decreasing probability of injury on the job, leading to a moral boost within the hospitality labor community. Decreasing the probability of injury for the workers will also benefit management as they will see a decrease in workers compensation for back and joint injuries. From the users perspective, the system is simple and easy to use. A basic infrared remote control will be the driving device and only feature buttons for raising the bed up, lowering the bed down, an toggling power for the remote itself.
The Hotel Bed Lifter is part of a large movement in the hospitality industry geared towards uniting the management side with the labor side. The solution is long-term and designed to save management money over a long period of time, while providing instant gratification and relief to the labor workers. Hopefully within the upcoming years, Hotel Bed Lifters will be installed on thousands of beds along the strip and provide a step towards unifying labor and management in the most important industry to the city of Las Vegas.
					<p>This project is still being built. It's been the first collaboration in a partnership between the Culinary Academy and the UNLV College of Engineering. My main efforts went toward electrical load calculations, mirocontroller programming, motor controls, and PCB design.</p>
